## Motivation

As part of my 2022 New Year's resolution I wanted to limit and track the time I was spending on Instagram. I started out recording my usage with a friend using Google Forms and Sheets. I saw the potential Power BI had to automate ETL processes and produce insightful visuals and calculations. By tracking my Instagram usage with Power BI, I have been able to decrease my average usage by 80% (at time of writing).

## Features

- Display Instagram usage over time
